# Projeditor
Just a little project for my studies at EICnam Paris, the goal is to create a little image editor with a couple of very simple and old library (ImageUtil.java & Afficheur.java).
Nothing fancy or interesting for any established developper here.
Still can help begginers understanding how object are used in a practical way in Java.
Sorry it's all in french.
